How to Run This Project:
1. run requirements.txt
2. make sure the tariff_sentiment_event_study_clean.py file is in the same directory as the unzipped sp500_summaries folder and the unzipped sp500_transcripts folder (The zipped files are too large to upload it on github)
3. (already done): run prep_events_csv.py script that converts the events_20251001.csv file into the events_20251001_updated.csv file for processing
4. run the tariff_sentiment_event_study_clean.py file (goes through all the content in the sp500 folder so will take a while)
5. The results are outputted in the command line as well as a folder named: outputs_v2_full (The results of the code is uploaded onto this github via zipped file outputs_v2_full)
